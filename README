No logins necessary for app.
Login functionality is in second sprint.

1st sprint recap:
- created all necessary activities and fragments
- created classes to represent items that will be sold and users of the app
- created all relationships between activities and fragments (switching to the appropriate activity/fragment
  when clicking a button or image, etc.)
- created a custom array adapter for our ListViews
- starting to implement more specific features like filters, savedpreferences, connecting the lists in 
  MyListings with MyProfile, and more
  
Second sprint general plan:
- implement database
- polish as necessary any 1st sprint work
    - eliminate bugs in CreateListing, AllListings
- generally make the app more dynamic
