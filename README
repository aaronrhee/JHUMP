No logins necessary for app.
Login functionality is in second sprint.

1st sprint recap:
- created all necessary activities and fragments
- created classes to represent items that will be sold and users of the app
- created all relationships between activities and fragments (switching to the appropriate activity/fragment
  when clicking a button or image, etc.)
- created a custom array adapter for our ListViews
- starting to implement more specific features like filters, savedpreferences, connecting the lists in 
  MyListings with MyProfile, and more

General state of app:
All the necessary activities and fragments are present. For each, bare bones functionality is present.
All layouts are more or less complete.
Particularly need to work on making any functionality relating to lists.
Also need to add a little bit to how activities and fragments communicate with each other, since
there is a lot of interdependent data. We found this a little tricky to work with since there's so 
much to keep track of. This and the database will be the main focus for our next sprint.
  
Second sprint general plan:
- implement database
- polish as necessary any 1st sprint work
    - eliminate bugs in CreateListing, AllListings
- generally make the app more dynamic
